Hope you still enjoyed though!\n\n--Story time!--\n\nSans paid a visit to Cross whom was hiding out in an unknown location only to be possessed by a dark entity *Cough*Nightmare*Cough* and this is why Cross shouldn't make deals with Nightmare fuel tentacle monsters LOL! \n\nYes that's a pretty short story but the video in the end explains it all. And yes, Sans is slowly being possessed or controlled. \n\nPlease note, anything in this video is fan made and not canon to stories made by original owners of the AUs such as Nightmare being able to possess. \n\nAnd if your wondering why Cross doesn't kill Nightmare, he dun have powers in this video. Either Nightmare blocked it off or he lost em or he's worn out. \n\n-Edit 2/14/2018-\n\nSince people WON'T SHUT THE FUCK UP AND STOP REPEATING QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER THE COMMENTS WILL STAY DISABLED!! \n\nI'll allow comments again by the end of April but right now NO ONE comments! -.- This is what fuckin happens if you repeat stupid questions over and over \"EUGHH CROSS CAN USE HIS KNIFE\" do you SEE his knife in the video? NO! \"UGHH Cross can teleport!\" Nightmare....DISABLED HIS POWERS!! \"He can ask Cross Chara for help\" The two hate each other, why dafuq would he help? \"Cross isn't a scaredy baby\" Okay then, what would YOU do in HIS situation with NO means of defense!? Also THERE ARE NO WINDOWS IN THE BED ROOM!\n\n*Sighs*\n\nLook, I'm sorry I'm peeved, but it's super fuckin annoying to hear these repetitive questions OVER AND OVER AGAIN! \n\nTHIS IS WHY DESCRIPTIONS EXIST IN THE VIDEO!\n\nAlso....IT'S FAN MADE! Fan made stuff isn't accurate! And yes, I Know Sans isn't Nightmare! My God! \n\nAnyway, that'll be all -.- You can comment again at the end of April.\n\n-Edit 06/08/2018\n\nAlright, since Color Glitch has developed more now I think its safe to enable comments on this video again. I am sorry for the acidic response I had but when you get repetitive questions on a \"FAN MADE\" video its like \"WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR LOGIC ON A NON CANON VIDEO??\" So yeah, I am sorry and after the recent Underverse episode I think its also safe to say people wont be asking me repeating questions anymore....(Hopefully) \n\n_ _ _ _\n\nDeviantArt: https://uketello.deviantart.com/\n\nArt commissions available: https://uketello.deviantart.com/journal/Paypal-Commissions-Undertale-Cuphead-TMNT-or-Sonic-711225849\n\nMy Tumblr: http://skelly-lover.tumblr.com/\n\nAO3:  http://archiveofourown.org/users/Uketello\n_ _ _ _\n\nCharacter(s): Undertale Sans, Nightmare & Cross Sans\n\nNightmare (c) by Jokublog\n\nCross Sans by Jakeinimation\n\nUndertale (c) by Toby Fox\n\nSong: Hide & Seek (English Cover) by Lizz Robinett\n\nSong link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-YNNJIe2Vk",

                "description": "This took over a few weeks but finally I'm done! Did something other than a meme! Woo! Sorry if some scenes are kinda crappy, admittedly sometimes I rushed a bit. Hope you still enjoyed though!\n\n--Story time!--\n\nSans paid a visit to Cross whom was hiding out in an unknown location only to be possessed by a dark entity *Cough*Nightmare*Cough* and this is why Cross shouldn't make deals with Nightmare fuel tentacle monsters LOL! \n\nYes that's a pretty short story but the video in the end explains it all. And yes, Sans is slowly being possessed or controlled. \n\nPlease note, anything in this video is fan made and not canon to stories made by original owners of the AUs such as Nightmare being able to possess. \n\nAnd if your wondering why Cross doesn't kill Nightmare, he dun have powers in this video. Either Nightmare blocked it off or he lost em or he's worn out. \n\n-Edit 2/14/2018-\n\nSince people WON'T SHUT THE FUCK UP AND STOP REPEATING QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER THE COMMENTS WILL STAY DISABLED!! \n\nI'll allow comments again by the end of April but right now NO ONE comments! -.- This is what fuckin happens if you repeat stupid questions over and over \"EUGHH CROSS CAN USE HIS KNIFE\" do you SEE his knife in the video? NO! \"UGHH Cross can teleport!\" Nightmare....DISABLED HIS POWERS!! \"He can ask Cross Chara for help\" The two hate each other, why dafuq would he help? \"Cross isn't a scaredy baby\" Okay then, what would YOU do in HIS situation with NO means of defense!? Also THERE ARE NO WINDOWS IN THE BED ROOM!\n\n*Sighs*\n\nLook, I'm sorry I'm peeved, but it's super fuckin annoying to hear these repetitive questions OVER AND OVER AGAIN! \n\nTHIS IS WHY DESCRIPTIONS EXIST IN THE VIDEO!\n\nAlso....IT'S FAN MADE! Fan made stuff isn't accurate! And yes, I Know Sans isn't Nightmare! My God! \n\nAnyway, that'll be all -.- You can comment again at the end of April.\n\n-Edit 06/08/2018\n\nAlright, since Color Glitch has developed more now I think its safe to enable comments on this video again. I am sorry for the acidic response I had but when you get repetitive questions on a \"FAN MADE\" video its like \"WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR LOGIC ON A NON CANON VIDEO??\" So yeah, I am sorry and after the recent Underverse episode I think its also safe to say people wont be asking me repeating questions anymore....(Hopefully) \n\n_ _ _ _\n\nDeviantArt: https://uketello.deviantart.com/\n\nArt commissions available: https://uketello.deviantart.com/journal/Paypal-Commissions-Undertale-Cuphead-TMNT-or-Sonic-711225849\n\nMy Tumblr: http://skelly-lover.tumblr.com/\n\nAO3:  http://archiveofourown.org/users/Uketello\n_ _ _ _\n\nCharacter(s): Undertale Sans, Nightmare & Cross Sans\n\nNightmare (c) by Jokublog\n\nCross Sans by Jakeinimation\n\nUndertale (c) by Toby Fox\n\nSong: Hide & Seek (English Cover) by Lizz Robinett\n\nSong link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-YNNJIe2Vk",
